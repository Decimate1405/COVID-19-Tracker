# COVID-19 Tracker in React.js
![image](https://i.imgur.com/Zump315.png)

I made this COVID-19 Tracker as a side project while learning react.js. The Tracker pulls data from the disease.sh API and displays it in graph form and as map which is interactive. You can view the worldwide data or by country and the data will change accordingly. The map data will change depending on the categories i.e. Total Cases, Recovered Cases or Deaths.

## To run this project on your machine, follow the steps below:

Open a terminal or cmd and type:

### `git clone https://github.com/Decimate1405/COVID-19-Tracker`

Navitage to the directory and type:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
